# `import HandShapeClassifier`

This library allows for recognition of certain hand shapes when using visionOS. It
currently supports `fist`, `openPalm` and `holding([Finger])` which contains the currently
held up fingers.

The detection method is naive and could be improved. Other shapes could be added as well.
Still, hope you find it useful.

If thereâ€™s already an API for this and I just missed it please let me know in the issues lol.

### Install:

You can just point to the `main` branch with Swift Package Manager.

### Usage:

```swift
// Start tracking hand movements
for await update in handTracker.anchorUpdates {
  // Get a hand skeleton
  guard let skeleton = update.anchor.handSkeleton else {
    continue
  }

  // Pass the skeleton to HandShape.classify
  if let shape = HandShape.classify(skeleton) {
    // Print out which hand and which shape
    print("\(update.anchor.chirality) is \(shape)")
  }
}
```
